# Service Mesh Integration with Advanced Traffic Management

## 🎯 Epic Overview

Implement deep integration with service mesh platforms (Istio, Linkerd, Consul Connect) to provide advanced traffic management, automatic mutual TLS, circuit breaking, rate limiting, and enhanced observability for Stellar services.

## 💼 Business Value

- **Enhanced Security**: Automatic mTLS between all services with zero-touch certificate management
- **Traffic Control**: Fine-grained traffic shaping, splitting, mirroring, and intelligent routing
- **Resilience**: Circuit breakers, retries, timeouts, and bulkhead patterns prevent cascade failures
- **Observability**: Deep insights into service-to-service communication with distributed tracing
- **Compliance**: Zero-trust networking with cryptographic service identity
- **Multi-Cluster**: Federation across multiple Kubernetes clusters for global deployments

## 📊 Project Summary

| **Difficulty** | Hard (200 points) |
| **Phases** | 7 phases, 60+ tasks |

## 🚀 Quick Start (After Implementation)

### For Platform Administrators

**1. Install Service Mesh (Istio Example)**
```bash
# Install Istio with minimal profile
istioctl install --set profile=minimal -y

# Or use Helm
helm install istio-base istio/base -n istio-system --create-namespace
helm install istiod istio/istiod -n istio-system
```

**2. Enable Service Mesh in Stellar-K8s**
```bash
helm upgrade stellar-operator stellar-k8s/stellar-operator \
  --set serviceMesh.enabled=true \
  --set serviceMesh.provider=istio \
  --set serviceMesh.defaultMtlsMode=STRICT
```

**3. Configure StellarNode with Mesh**
```yaml
apiVersion: stellar.org/v1alpha1
kind: StellarNode
metadata:
  name: horizon-mesh
spec:
  nodeType: Horizon
  network: Mainnet
  version: "v21.0.0"
  
  # Service mesh configuration
  serviceMesh:
    sidecarInjection: true
    istio:
      mtlsMode: STRICT
      circuitBreaker:
        consecutiveErrors: 5
        timeWindowSecs: 30
      retries:
        maxRetries: 3
        backoffMs: 25
      trafficSplitting:
        enabled: true
        canaryWeight: 10  # 10% canary traffic
```

### For Operators
