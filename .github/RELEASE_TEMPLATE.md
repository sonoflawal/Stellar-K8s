## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE

1. COPY this file's content into the GitHub Release description when creating
   a new release at: https://github.com/stellar/stellar-k8s/releases/new

2. REPLACE all placeholders:
   - [VERSION]       → the new version, e.g. 0.2.0
   - [PREV_VERSION]  → the previous version, e.g. 0.1.0
   - YYYY-MM-DD      → today's date
   - PR_NUMBER / ISSUE_NUMBER → actual GitHub numbers
   - <hash>          → SHA-256 values from the release workflow's SHA256SUMS file

3. REMOVE any sections that don't apply to this release
   (e.g. no Breaking Changes → delete that whole section).

4. FILL IN the Highlights paragraph last — it's easier once all other
   sections are complete.

5. VERIFY checksums are populated. The release workflow generates a
   SHA256SUMS file automatically; copy values from there.

6. PREVIEW the release in GitHub's editor before publishing to confirm
   all links resolve and the formatting looks correct.

Tip: The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) auto-generates
a changelog via git-cliff. Use that output as a starting point for the
Features and Bug Fixes sections, then add context and links manually.

<!-- Format: - **[Change Name]**: Detailed explanation of what changed and migration path -->

- **[Breaking Change]**: Detailed explanation of what changed, why it was necessary, and how users should migrate their code/configuration.
